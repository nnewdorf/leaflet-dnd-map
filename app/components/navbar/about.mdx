# Leaflet DND Map
A fantasy map made for a homebrew DND game. The map includes a tool for measuring travel time depending on mode of transportation (time is calculated in days). There are also pins that can be selected for more info about a particular location.

## Disclaimers
The map currently has placeholder names taken from the real world as I flesh things out these will change. None of the notes attached to a location should be misconstrued as a commentary on that particular location in the real world.
