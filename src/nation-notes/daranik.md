## Daranik
The capital city of Korensa, Daranik is a beacon of industry in a magic filled world. While Ilze is the preferred city of commerce, Korensa is the preferred city of manufacturing. It is also the city of politics.

During the Promethean Schism shortly after the Shift, one side wished to found a new aristocracy while the others demanded a new representative form of government. Daranik was the first city founded by the former group in what would eventually become the nation of Korensa. The families of the aristocracy began with power consolidated from the Olympic war, and further consolidated by monopolistic tendencies in business dealings. A non-exhaustive list includes:
* Maru - Firearms manufacturing, explosives, mining.
* Zeri - Classic armaments, many types of smithing, some masonry.
* Tandy - Transportation, warehousing, post
