# Campaign 2 Map
Welcome. This is an interactive map for a TTRPG that I am currently running. If you stumbled accross this site you are welcome to use it for your own campaign, but I encourage you to read the info below before deciding to do so

## Usage:
There are 3 sets of buttons:
1. Lables: Toggles the white text labels on the map to be shown or hidden
2. Drag - Measure: Determines what happens when you click and hold while moving your mouse
    * Drag: Pans around the map 
    * Measure: Calculates the time (in days) required to travel a given distance
3. Walking - Horse - Boat: Modify how quickly the travel is done
    * Walking: 1x
    * Horse: 2x
    * Boat: 3x

In addition, any city marker can be selected to show a pop up with information about that location

## Disclaimers:
* Most of the cities do not yet have data in their pop ups (it just repeats their name). This will be updated as I have time to go through and do more world building
* No location is meant to represent or reflect any real world location, and any resemblance (name, geography, etc.)  should not be misconstrued as a commentary on a particular location.
