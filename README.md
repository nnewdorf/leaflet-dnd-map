# Leaflet DND Map
A fantasy map made for a homebrew DND game. The map includes a tool for measuring travel time depending on mode of transportation (time is calculated in days). There are also pins that can be selected for more info about a particular location.

## Disclaimers
The information on this map is in no way meant to reflect any location in the real world. Any resemblance to real world locations (names, geographies, etc.) should not be misconstrued as a commentary on that particular location.

This map started as a simple GIMP project several years ago. Since that time I have switched operating systems and lost the original brush pack. While I remember attribution not being necessary, if you recognize any of the symbols and know who made them please let me know so I can credit them properly.

## Known Issues
Currently MUI isn't really doing much, it could be removed, but I plan to use it to clean up the look of the user interface later on.

Only Daranik has a fleshed out pop up, every other city just shows its name. I plan to update cities over time either when I want to do some world building or when my party is on their way to a particular destination
